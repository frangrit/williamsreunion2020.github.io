# 🎉 Williams family reunion 2020 

- **When:** June 28 - July 5
- **Where:** Manzanita, OR


## 📍 Location

The reunion nexus is at Dan and Debbie Williams' house, at [30 Hallie Lane, Manzanita, OR](https://goo.gl/maps/EYK9GneynYkbYz5w9). Manzanita is a charming little beach town; just about anywhere in town will be close enough. In particular, the areas around Beach St., Carmel Ave., and Laneda Ave. are within walking distance of Dan and Debbie's and the beach.

Debbie suggests working with a local realtor to rent a place and recommends this one:

## 🗓️ Family activities + events

We plan to coordinate family potlucks and cookouts, plus local group activities like paddleboarding, tidepooling, pickle ball playing, hiking, fish-and-chip eating, and pub crawling. More details as we get closer to the date; let us know if there is an activity you'd like to host.

## 🏄‍♀️ Other things to do

We'll collect a few ideas for local activities and sights aside from the group gatherings.
