# Williams family reunion 2020

- **When:** June 28 - July 5
- **Where:** Manzanita, OR


## 📍 Location

The reunion nexus is at Dan and Debbie Williams' house, at [30 Hallie Lane, Manzanita](https://goo.gl/maps/EYK9GneynYkbYz5w9). Manzanita is a small town; anything in town will be close. In particular, the areas around Beach St., Carmel Ave., and Laneda Ave. will be within walking distance of Dan and Debbie's and the beach.

Debbie suggests working with a local realtor to rent a place.

## 🤔 Good to know

The main thing we want to stress is that coastal weather can be unpredictable and sometimes cold and wet. Bring layers. More soon!
