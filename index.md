## 🗓️ Family activities + events

We plan to coordinate family potlucks and cookouts, plus local group activities like paddleboarding, tidepooling, pickle ball playing, hiking, fish-and-chip eating, and pub crawling. More details as we get closer to the date; let us know if there is an activity you'd like to host.

## 🏄‍♀️ Other things to do

We'll collect a few ideas for local activities and sights aside from the group gatherings.

## 🤔 Good to know

For now, the main thing we want to stress is that coastal weather can be unpredictable and sometimes cold and wet. Adjust your expectations -- and bring layers. More soon!
